Here's a job as a wine maker where you can harvest, press and bottle your own wine. The process takes place in three stages: harvesting, pressing and filling. Following this, employees will receive a percentage of sales, while a share will be paid to the company. The base split is 40% for the player and 60% for the company.

At the moment, the script is only available in ESX. We are in the process of converting it to Qbcore, and this should be completed in a few days. We are working to ensure a smooth integration and to guarantee the availability of the script under Qbcore within the expected timeframe. Thank you for your understanding and patience.

We are excited to share that a significant code optimization phase is underway to enhance the performance of our Winemaker script. Our development team is committed to ensuring a smoother and more responsive user experience.

Over the next few weeks, our focus will be on identifying and improving critical sections of the Winemaker script's source code. The primary goal is to optimize performance, reduce processing times, and ensure more efficient use of resources.

Key areas of attention include loop optimization, variable management, and enhancing the efficiency of core functions. These adjustments aim to alleviate the script's load, minimize response times, and provide a more enjoyable user experience.

During this period, you may notice frequent script updates as we implement continuous improvements. Each modification is rigorously tested to maintain script stability and avoid any major disruptions.

We appreciate your understanding and support during this optimization phase. We are confident that these efforts will make Winemaker more robust and reliable for all users.

Stay tuned for regular updates on our progress, and feel free to share your feedback with us.
