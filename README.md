Here's a job as a wine maker where you can harvest, press and bottle your own wine. The process takes place in three stages: harvesting, pressing and filling. Following this, employees will receive a percentage of sales, while a share will be paid to the company. The base split is 40% for the player and 60% for the company.

At the moment, the script is only available in ESX. We are in the process of converting it to Qbcore, and this should be completed in a few days. We are working to ensure a smooth integration and to guarantee the availability of the script under Qbcore within the expected timeframe. Thank you for your understanding and patience.
